# Week 6: Capstone Full Stack Project (Advanced)

**Objective:** Combine front-end, back-end, and database into a complete project.

## Tasks
- Plan and design a full-stack web application (e.g., Task Manager / Blog / Notes App / eCommerce Lite).
- Build front-end using React and styling libraries (Bootstrap, Tailwind CSS, or plain CSS).
- Build back-end APIs using Node.js and Express.
- Integrate MongoDB for data storage (using Mongoose).
- Deploy your application on Render / Netlify / Vercel / Cyclic (for front-end) and Render / Cyclic / Railway (for backend). Submit code + live project link + report.
